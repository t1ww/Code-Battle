## To solve server stuck

Find it's port by runnning (ex. port=10602)

      netstat -ano | findstr :10602

You'll get something like so, last column is it's id

      TCP    0.0.0.0:10602          0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING       65580

Then kill it with found id

      taskkill /pid 65580 /f
